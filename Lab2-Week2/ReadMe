Here is the ReadMe file.

DatabaseCommand ———  stores the initial codes for database access;

mydblp.xml ———  stores the first 1000 items from dblp.xml;

dblp.dtd ——   stores the format for the .xml file;

When you import my project, remember to change the path in following files:

DatabaseOperations : line 7 ———  change the DatabaseCommand file path.

MyDOMParser :  line 27  ———  change the mydblp.xml file path.

And you may need to add dblp.dtd in system.dir


When you test my codes, you could also find the outputs in console.

Every function is implemented successfully. 

Please feel free to contact with me if you have any question about my project.

Hope you have a good day ! Thank you !
